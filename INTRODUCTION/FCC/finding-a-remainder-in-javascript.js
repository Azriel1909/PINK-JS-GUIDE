// The Remainder operator % gives the remainder of the division of two numbers
const remainder = 11 % 3;
console.log(remainder);

/* In mathematics, a number can be checked to be even or odd by checking
the remainder of the division by 2. Even numbers have a remainder of 0, while odd numbers have a remainder of 1
*/

// ! The remainder operator is sometimes incorrectly referred to as the modulus operator. It is very similar to modulus, but does not work properly with negative numbers.
