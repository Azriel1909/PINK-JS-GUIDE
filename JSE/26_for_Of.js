// * The Break and Continue Statements

// > The Break Statement is used to termine the execution of a loop or a switch statement.

let i = 0

// An infinitive Loop

while (true){
  console.log(i)
  i++
  if (i>=9){
    break
  }
}

// > The Continue Statement can be used in loops but no in the switch statement. It applies to the closest surrounding loop. It does not end the whole loop, but rather starts the next iteration of the loop.

console.log('-----------------------------')

for (let i = 0; i <= 19; i++){
  if (i == 9) {
    continue
  }
  console.log(i)
}

// ! The program skips the number 9, this happens because when i equals 9, the continue statement is executed, ending this iteration and skipping the console.log statement and starting another one.

// ? Both break and continue are not used particularly often. We should definitely not use them when we can terminate the loop with a properly constructed condition.

// * The Break Keyword: In contrast to if statements, switch statements do not execute just one branch, but rather they execute the entire code from the 1st case that matches until the end of the switch statement.

// > This behavior is called Pass-Through and has some uses, but most of the time, we want to execute only one branch, and for that reason the break keyword is present.
