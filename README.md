We use computers mainly because they are able to perform certain tasks incomparably faster and more accurately than people. The higher the language level, the less we need to know about the hardware on which the program is executed

## What is JavaScript?
___
It is an interpreted language, running a program in JavaScript looks as if we are executing our source code step by step. JavaScript is also a high level language (i.e. relatively easy to understand for people).
### JavaScript Engines
Most modern JavaScript engine use the Just In Time Compilation technique (JIT Compilation). This technique consists of compiling code in fragments during the execution of the program and allow us to increase its performance. 

### History
In 1995, the Netscape corporation hired Brendan Eich, and tasked him to develop a new language for their product *The Netscape Navigator Web Browser*. The new language was calles LiveScript, but soon after its name was changed to JavaScript. Its main task was to **to add dynamics to websites**.

## Client-Side vs Server-Side programming
#### Server-Side apps = Backend Development
This programs are executed on servers processing data from databases, which after processing will be available on the client side.
### Frameworks
To built complex web apps and social networks.
1. React
2. Angular
#### Debugger
It is  a tool that allow us to pause a program in the indicated place and analyze its current state.
## Environments
### Online Environment
They usually are called as *code playgrounds*, are sites that act as a simple editor and runtime environment.
- _[JSFiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/)_
- _[CodePen](https://codepen.io/pen/)_
- _[JsBin](https://jsbin.com/)_
- _[Plunker](https://plnkr.co/)_
### Local Environment
Just three elements are required:
1. Code Editor
2. Interpreter
3. Debugger

For advanced level:
1. Package managers (npm or yarn)
2. Task runners and module bundlers (Grunt or Webpack)
3. Testing framework (Mocha, Jasmine or Jest)
4. Security analyzers (Snyk, RetireJs or OWASP Dependency Check)
